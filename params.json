  "body": "### FTP3DS.\r\nOn this page you can find some basic info on FTP3DS as well as the download and source links above.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\nFTP3DS is a fork of [mtheall's](https://www.github.com/mtheall/) [FTPD](https://github.com/mtheall/ftpd) that uses buildtools and thus allows for a single `make` in the project directory even when on vanilla DevkitARM / CTRULib.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\n- Works well with a variety of clients.\r\n\r\n- Supports multiple simultaneous clients. The 3DS itself only appears to support enough sockets to perform 4-5 simultaneous data transfers, so it will help if you limit your FTP client to this many parallel requests.\r\n\r\n### Building\r\n------------------\r\nInstall and set up [devkitARM and libctru](http://3dbrew.org/wiki/Setting_up_Development_Environment). \r\n\r\nClone this repository and cd in the resulting directory. Then run the following command:\r\n\r\n`make`\r\n\r\nThis will create the `/output` folder with all required files.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@mtheall for all his great work on FTPD. This project would never ever exist without.\r\n\r\n@steveice10 for his work on bannertool, project_ctr and through that also buildtools.\r\n\r\n@usagirei for his great help for switching from ctrulib make to buildtools make as well as tracking down a bug in bannertool.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nContact me on [Twitter @Favna_](https://twitter.com/favna_) or create an [issue on github](https://github.com/Favna/FTP3DS/issues)",
